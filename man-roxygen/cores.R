#' @param cores The number of cores to use for parallelization. The default for
#'   an entire R session can be set with \code{options(loo.cores = NUMBER)}. As
#'   of version \code{2.0.0} the \strong{default is now 1 core}, but we
#'   recommend using as many (or close to as many) cores as possible.
