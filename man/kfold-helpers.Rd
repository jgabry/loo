\title{Helper functions for K-fold cross-validation}
\usage{
kfold_split_random(K = 10, N = NULL)

kfold_split_balanced(K = 10, x = NULL)

kfold_split_stratified(K = 10, x = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{K}{The number of folds to use.}

\item{N}{The number of observations in the data.}

\item{x}{A discrete variable of length \code{N}. Will be coerced to
\code{\link{factor}}. For \code{kfold_split_balanced} \code{x} should be a
binary variable. For \code{kfold_split_stratified} \code{x} should be a
grouping variable with at least \code{K} levels.}
}
\value{
An integer vector of length \code{N} where each element is an index
  in \code{1:K}.
}
\description{
These functions can be used to generate indexes for use with K-fold
cross-validation.
}
\details{
\code{kfold_split_random} splits the data into \code{K} groups
of equal size (or roughly equal size).

For a binary variable \code{x} that has many more \code{0}s than \code{1}s
(or vice-versa) \code{kfold_split_balanced} first splits the data by value of
\code{x}, does \code{kfold_split_random} within each of the two groups, and
then recombines the indexes returned from the two calls to
\code{kfold_split_random}. This helps ensure that the observations in the
less common category of \code{x} are more evenly represented across the
folds.

\examples{
kfold_split_random(K = 5, N = 20)

y <- sample(c(0, 1), size = 200, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.05, 0.95))
table(y)
ids <- kfold_split_balanced(K = 5, x = y)
table(ids[y == 0])

grp <- gl(n = 50, k = 15, labels = state.name)
ids <- kfold_split_stratified(K = 10, grp)
cbind(ids, grp)
