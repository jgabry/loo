\title{Model comparison}
\usage{
compare(..., x = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{At least two objects returned by \code{\link{loo}} (or
\code{\link{waic}}).}

\item{x}{A list of at least two objects returned by \code{\link{loo}} (or
\code{\link{waic}}). This argument can be used as an alternative to
specifying the objects in \code{...}.}
}
\value{
A vector or matrix with class \code{'compare.loo'} that has its own
  print method. If exactly two objects are provided in \code{...} or
  \code{x}, then the difference in expected predictive accuracy and the
  standard error of the difference are returned (see Details). \emph{The
  difference will be positive if the expected predictive accuracy for the
  second model is higher.} If more than two objects are provided then a
  matrix of summary information is returned.
}
\description{
Compare fitted models on LOO or WAIC.
}
\details{
When comparing two fitted models, we can estimate the difference in
  their expected predictive accuracy by the difference in \code{elpd_loo} or
  \code{elpd_waic} (multiplied by \eqn{-2}, if desired, to be on the deviance
  scale). To compute the standard error of this difference we can use a
  paired estimate to take advantage of the fact that the same set of \eqn{N}
  data points was used to fit both models. These calculations should be most
  useful when \eqn{N} is large, because then non-normality of the
  distribution is not such an issue when estimating the uncertainty in these
  sums. These standard errors, for all their flaws, should give a better
  sense of uncertainty than what is obtained using the current standard
  approach of comparing differences of deviances to a Chi-squared
  distribution, a practice derived for Gaussian linear models or
  asymptotically, and which only applies to nested models in any case.
