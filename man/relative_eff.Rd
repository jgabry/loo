\usage{
relative_eff(x, ...)

\method{relative_eff}{default}(x, chain_id, ...)

\method{relative_eff}{matrix}(x, chain_id, ...)

\method{relative_eff}{array}(x, ...)

\method{relative_eff}{function}(x, chain_id, ..., data, draws)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector, matrix, 3-D array, or function. See the \strong{Methods
(by class)} section below for details on the shape of \code{x}. For use
with the \code{loo} function, the values in \code{x} (or generated by
\code{x} if \code{x} is a function) should be likelihood values (i.e.,
\code{exp(log_lik)}). For generic \code{use} with \code{\link{psis}}, the
values in \code{x} should be the reciprocal of the importance ratios (i.e.,
\code{exp(-log_ratios)}).}

\item{chain_id}{A vector of length \code{NROW(x)} containing MCMC chain
indexes for each each row of \code{x} (if a matrix) or each value in
\code{x} (if a vector). No \code{chain_id} is needed if \code{x} is a 3-D
array. If there are \code{C} chains then valid chain indexes are values
in \code{1:C}.}

\item{data, draws, ...}{Same as for the \code{\link{loo}} function method.}
}
\value{
A vector of relative effective sample sizes.
}
\description{
\code{relative_eff} computes the the MCMC effective sample size divided by
the total sample size.
}
\section{Methods (by class)}{
\itemize{
\item \code{default}: A vector of length \eqn{S} (posterior sample size).

\item \code{matrix}: An \eqn{S} by \eqn{N} matrix, where \eqn{S} is the size
of the posterior sample (with all chains merged) and \eqn{N} is the number
of data points.

\item \code{array}: An \eqn{I} by \eqn{C} by \eqn{N} array, where \eqn{I}
is the number of MCMC iterations per chain, \eqn{C} is the number of
chains, and \eqn{N} is the number of data points.

\item \code{function}: A function \code{f} that takes arguments \code{data_i} and \code{draws} and
  returns a vector containing the log-likelihood for a single observation
  \code{i} evaluated at each posterior draw. The function should be written
  such that, for each observation \code{i} in \code{1:N}, evaluating
  \code{f(data_i = data[i,, drop=FALSE], draws = draws)} results in a vector
  of length \code{S} (size of posterior sample). The log-likelihood function
  can also have additional arguments but \code{data_i} and \code{draws} are
  required.

 If using the function method then the arguments \code{data}
 and \code{draws} must also be specified in the call to \code{loo}:
 \itemize{
   \item \code{data}: A data frame or matrix containing the data (e.g.
   observed outcome and predictors) needed to compute the pointwise
   log-likelihood. For each observation \code{i}, the \code{i}th row of
   \code{data} will be passed to the \code{data_i} argument of the
   log-likelihood function.
   \item \code{draws}: An object containing the posterior draws for any
   parameters needed to compute the pointwise log-likelihood. Unlike
   \code{data}, which is indexed by observation, for each observation the
   entire object \code{draws} will be passed to the \code{draws} argument of
   the log-likelihood function.
   \item The \code{...} can be used to pass additional arguments to your
   log-likelihood function. These arguments ase used like the \code{draws}
   argument in that they are recycled for each observation.
